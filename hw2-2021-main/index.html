      <div id="intro">
        <h2>Say what?</h2>
        <p>The popular American card game Uno has simple rules, right? Wrong! Here are some rules you're probably playing incorrectly.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="red">
        <h2>If you don't have a card to play, you only have to pick up one card</h2>
        <p>You don't have to keep drawing cards until you get one that matches the discard pile, and you can even play it right away!</p>
      </div>

      <div id="blue">
        <h2>You can't stack or chain cards</h2>
        <p>Sorry, you can't make your little brother pick up 6 cards by playing a draw 2 after a draw 4. If a draw card is played, the next player picks up the cards and misses their turn.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="yellow">
        <h2>You can win with an action card</h2>
        <p>Wild, Skip, even Reverse - doesn't matter as long as it matches the color!</p>
      </div>

      <div id="green">
        <h2>In two player mode Reverse is treated as a Skip</h2>
        <p>The other player's turn is skipped and you can play again right away. Same with draw cards!</p>
      </div>
